download the code as zip or clone it using git clone 

check if the required modules are installed 
  •	torch==2.2.0
  •	torchvision==0.16.0
  •	timm==0.9.8
  •	pillow==10.0.0
  •	numpy==1.26.0

dataset needed:
  celeb df
  faceforensics c23 ++
  real vs fake images
  real vs fake faces

run the train.py or b4 train.py or the other trainin code based on ur GPU requirements 

run the code for many hours and wait till top accuracy is reached

after the model training check the saved path 

then run the streamlit code and set the path for models based on the path 

upload the video and check it in the streamlit page 



each streamlit has different purposes - 
1.face extraction
2.frame analysis
